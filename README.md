# Smart-Dosage
 - Water treatment plant relied on jar testing to
determine a proper coagulant dose which usually
causes under or over dosage.
- My solution is to train a machine-learning
algorithm to predict the optimal dosage value.
- This allows operators to react fast to everchanging water quality parameter such as turbidity
while reducing chemical usage cost.
- Future plan, if i got access to the data is to train
the model with more parameters and allows
automatic retrain.
